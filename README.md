## My Computer Experience:
I am currently a 1st year graduate student pursuing my Master’s degree in computer science. I completed my undergrad in Computer Science
Courses that I am really interested in and have successfully completed are:
*	Randomized and approximate algorithms.
*	Operating system and UNIX.
*	Algorithm Design and Analysis.

I have completed an IoT based project in my Internship in ExpertsHub called “TRASH TRUCK”. I also completed a project called “Automobile Safety” where I have designed an automobile with automatic steering using voice control technique and obstacle detection for minimizing the occurrence and consequences of traffic collisions. I also developed a game called “Battle ship” using C language.

### How is learning Web Server Programming helping me in future:
I have always used Web pages for various reasons, but never created one. It would be exciting to create my own web page. I am looking forward to learn how a web server works. It’s usually hard to decide if an item is suitable for a person or not when we are shopping online. I would like create a web page where the client can check whether the purchased item is suitable to him/her by virtually trying it out.
